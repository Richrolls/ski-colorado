3/24/23 - Initialized project fork. Previously during the week, team roles were elected and assigned, a code of conduct was collaboratively
assembled and agreed to, project wireframing was collaboratively completed, and necessary APIs were identified. Requisite API keys were obtained,
and API data was successfully queried and returned via Insomnia.

3/27/23 - Began day by splitting into two teams, one to work on API framing and another to work on authentication. For continuity and consistency, reverted to single team to complete API framing before working on authentication. Strictly defined all MongoDB collection schemas in docs/api-design.md, and achieved get all, get single, create, and delete query/router functionalities for the 'resorts' collection and successfully tested/implemeted via FastAPI browser.

3/28/23 - Began day by initializing authentication for Account and Comment API endpoints via codealong with lecture. Team Standup followed lecture, and we agreed to work on applying authentication to other models. Afternoon was spent learning how to apply endpoint authentication to the Resorts models, which are not directly associated with a user_id. Successfully implemented by end of day, team plans to work on applying authentication to Favorites tomorrow.
