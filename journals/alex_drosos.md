3/27/23 - Contributed to API design and created spreadsheet with all necessary pieces of data for 15 resorts.
3/28/23 - Finalized resort data spreadsheet and applied changes to resort fields to accommodate new data.
3/29/23 -
3/30/23 - Began work on design of SkiColorado main page. Worked through some issues with package installations.
4/3/23 - Continued work on main page with goal to finish. Collaborated with Eric to tweak existing elements until we were happy with product.
4/4/23 - Implemented few additional features to main page with Eric, including raining snow on page. Compiled all resort data into formatted strings for future ease of populating database.
4/7/23 - wrote function and added fields in resortdetail.js
4/17/23 - Played around some more with twitter's timeline embedding generator code and could not get it to display. Found and installed the react-twitter-widgets npm package. Tweaked setting and framed the widget in matching styling so that it would fit in with other elements on the page.
4/18/23 - Met with Eric and came up with final solution for positioning/spacing on the resort list page. Previously, I had worked on implementing the "toLocaleString()" method to add correct commas to resort statistic numbers in the thousands, however, on refresh it would break the page. Never found a solution so today I wrote a function from scratch that accomplishes what I was looking for without breaking the webpage.
4/24/23 - Added Navbar to profile page. Added @username to profile page and changed picture to round instead of square. Finally figured out how to get skier/snowboarder icons centered. Wrote a function to only show last initial when someone else views your profile page for privacy reasons. This is similar to the way we hide the street address from others.
