    Worked with Alex and Anton to come up with API routes. Jack shared his screen and took the lead on coding. We made the models for Resorts, Accounts, Favorites, and Comments; We also made the queries to get, post, put, and delete resorts. Got over our first major hurdle as a team and got our resort list query working.

    I realized that I need to go back and go over how FastAPI works, felt we could have been much farther ahead if I had more to contribute. Felt like all I could do was support instead of work through a section.

    Worked as a group to finish coding in the API routes for resorts, accounts, favorites, and comments. Also got authentication working for the routes.

    Looking forward to working on the front end and seeing the project in action.
