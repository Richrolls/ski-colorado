    Worked with Alex and Anton to come up with API routes. Jack shared his screen and took the lead on coding. We made the models for Resorts, Accounts, Favorites, and Comments; We also made the queries to get, post, put, and delete resorts. Got over our first major hurdle as a team and got our resort list query working.

    I realized that I need to go back and go over how FastAPI works, felt we could have been much farther ahead if I had more to contribute. Felt like all I could do was support instead of work through a section.

    Worked as a group to finish coding in the API routes for resorts, accounts, favorites, and comments. Also got authentication working for the routes.

    Looking forward to working on the front end and seeing the project in action.

    Got more progress on getting the favorites queries to work, we will need to see if we can get the queries to work with a single Model rather than ModelIn and ModelOut. I started working on the LoginForm.js file. I will need to figure out how to create a token upon account creation.

    Looking forward to figuring out how to link front-end and back-end. Confused on how to implement the token generation.
