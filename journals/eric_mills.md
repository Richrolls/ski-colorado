Week 1 --
Ideation/brainstorming
Team decided on SkiColorado (working title)
A guide/social app for rating and checking conditions of the most prominent ski resorts in Colorado

Lots of wireframing

My first individual task was selecting and testing a Weather API to display current/forecasted weather conditions at the various resorts.
WeatherAPI.com is perfect. Highly customizable and responsive.

Today (Friday's) task is to get it all set up in Insomnia and whatnot to make sure we can "GET" the data and start figuring out how to incorporate it

Week 2 --
Day 1: collaborate with Jack on Authentication
Pivot to APIs as a group of 5
Lots of troubleshooting re: MongoDB and how to get it to properly function

Day 2: Authorization with Jack (all hands on deck)

Day 3: Spent hours trying to build one-to-many relationships between Accounts -> Favorites and Resorts -> Favorites. Can't figure it out. Tried a thousand different things. None of them worked.
We asked for help and with that Jack ended up figuring it out! Favorites seem to

Day 4: Finalized Favorites with Jack, trying to make sure we've implemented it in a way that will work with the Front End

Day 5: Friday off

Week 3

Day 1: Collaborate with Alex on Front End. Lots of experimenting and troubleshooting with the background image to get the right aesthetic. Went through 10-12 iterations of the background image and lengthened it vertically to eliminate empty white space.

Day 2: FINISHED Main Page with Alex! SNOWFALL!

Day 3: Signup Page Aesthetics. CSS/HTML/Bootstrap etc. It's finished! I think.

Day 4: Had to redo the signup page stuff due to a git/merge conflict causing us to lose all of the styling/changes

Day 5: Stylized login page

Week 4

Right before the break, I pushed the "back" button after working on it with Alex

Day 1: Stylized home page (resorts list) with Alex

Day 2: Finished stylizing home page with incorporated Twitter feed resizing. Worked on NavBar (profile icon and logout).

Day 3: Worked on stylizing Individual Resort Pages

Week 5

Day 1: Reconfigured all <a> tags and related functionality to React component <Link> tags with appropriate syntax

Day 2: Reconfigured and stylized buttons on comment/rating input. Assisted Jack/Anton with home page filtering.

Day 3: WEATHER API!!! WOOO!!!! 404 Page!!! YAHOO!!!
