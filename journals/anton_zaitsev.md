Caught up on the FastAPI lectures, and developed and refined the structure of the data pertaining to the Users and Resorts models.

Followed along to Jack's explanation of the backend of our application, as well as the user authorization process. Also caught up on the functionality of FastAPI and the funcationality of MongoDB.

Followed along the coding of the Favorites, and how to organize its relation to users and resorts, respectively. Started working on the front-end with Alex and Richard. Implemented a basic Nav file, navigation in the App.js file, a basic MainPage file, and started working on the Login form. Will continuie tomorrow.

Continued developing the code for the login form component of the front-end. Was able to debug the styling via proper use of div and label tags. Was not successful at completing the form as of yet, as I am getting 422 errors.

4/3/23
Worked with Jack on arranging the logged in home page and styling it. Lead the daily stand ups.

Since I forgot to update throughout the week, the major points that I worked in was redirect route logic to the sign up form from the login form, and vice versa. Also implementing login user authorization, so that the user is redirected to the main page of a list of all resorts with them displaying properly.

Have not journaled for almost three weeks, but as a general summary the big things that I worked on was the login logic, login error logic, and the user login authentication associated with login. I also worked with Jack on styling the basic wireframe for the home page that displays all of the resorts. In addition, I worked on the front-end filtering logic to dynamically display resorts based on the selected filters. And today, I wrote the unit tests for querying for a list of all accounts, and querying for a specific account.
